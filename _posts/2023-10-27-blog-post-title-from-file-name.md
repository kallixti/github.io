The productivity black hole. Otherwise known as the "I have this thing I really need to do but I honestly cannot bring myself to sit and do it, oh shit does this mean my adderall has finally stopped working and my ADHD finally won?" black hole.

In an attempt to avoid the work that I need to do, I opted to learn how one can create a "blog" (style) site utilizing GitHub Pages. 

This template is derived from [someone](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) I found via using the Googles, and it effectively removes the need of the user to know HTML, CSS, etc. Nice for a starting point, though I would like to refresh my HTML and CSS knowledge, so I am sure I'll be playing around with this. 

Fun. Stuff.
